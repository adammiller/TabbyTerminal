# USAGE:

# If no parameters are passed in, it will open a new tab in terminal with the current working directory
# If a path is passed in it will open a new terminal tab and attempt to cd to that path
# If a command is passed in, it will attempt to execute the command after the new tab has been opened and the directory set
